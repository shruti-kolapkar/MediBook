🏥 MediBook – Web Application

Online Medical Appointment Booking System (Django)

📌 Introduction

MediBook is a full-stack web application built using Django that allows users to book medical appointments with doctors through a clean and user-friendly interface.

Unlike simple static healthcare websites, MediBook provides dynamic doctor listings, appointment booking, and an admin panel to manage doctors and approve or reject appointments. The system is designed to demonstrate clean backend architecture, role-based actions (user & admin), and a responsive UI suitable for real-world healthcare booking platforms.

❗ Problem Statement

Traditional clinic or hospital appointment systems:

Are often manual or phone-call based

Do not provide real-time appointment booking

Lack proper admin control over appointment approvals

Provide poor user experience

Are difficult to scale and manage

Do not maintain digital appointment history

This project solves these problems by providing a database-driven, scalable web application with structured backend logic and an admin-controlled appointment workflow.
