# 🏥 MediBook - Web Application
## Full-Stack Doctor Appointment & Medical Record Management System (Django)


## 📌 Introduction  
The **MediBook Web Application** is a full-stack healthcare platform built using **Django** that allows users (patients) to book doctor appointments, view doctor profiles, and manage basic medical information through a clean and user-friendly interface.

Unlike basic static healthcare websites, this application provides **dynamic appointment booking, backend-driven doctor listings, and an admin panel** for managing doctors, patients, and schedules. The system is designed to demonstrate **clean architecture, responsive UI, and efficient backend data handling**, making it suitable for learning full-stack development and building real-world healthcare web applications.


## ❗ Problem Statement

- Are often static and lack real-time booking functionality  
- Do not support dynamic doctor availability and scheduling  
- Provide poor user experience for patients

- Are difficult to scale and maintain  

This project addresses these issues by implementing a **database-driven, scalable web application** with structured backend logic and a responsive frontend.
